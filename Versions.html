	<h3>Versions</h3>
	
	<p>There are two versions of this API. Version 1 does not require registration and Version 2 requires registration of a key, but doesnâ€™t give us much specific advice on how to use it. There are some examples for using it in POSTS, but no clear way to send it in a GET request. The key does give you some additional functionality including more queries per day and more information available from those queries. It is easier than one might think to overdo it with queries and if you are relaying on version 1 you can easily find yourself getting a response like I did when setting up this guide:
