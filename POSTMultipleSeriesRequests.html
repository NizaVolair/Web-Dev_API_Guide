	<h3>POST Multiple Series Requests</h3>
	
	<p>Youâ€™ll need to specify in the content-type header that this is an application/json request
	A simple payload will look something like this:
	<pre><code>{
		"registrationKey":"yourKeyHere"
		}
		The following code should give you an example of the differences:
		app.post("/postPage", function(req, res, next){
			var context = {};
			console.log("test");
			request({
				"url":"http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/",
				"method":"POST",
				"headers":{"Content-Type":"application/json"},
				"body":{"seriesid":["CEU0800000003","LAUCN040010000000006"],
				"registrationKey":"831b88021f4847d4ab40b5f94b9118ee"}
			}, function(err, response, body){
				console.log("test2");
				if(!err && response.statusCode < 400){
					context.results = body;
					res.render('YourPage', context);
					console.log(context.results);
				}
				else{
						if(response){
							console.log(response.statusCode);
						}
						next(err);
				}
			});
		});
	}</code></pre>
	<p>Lets go ahead and step-by-step this one as well to understand what we're doing:
	<ul>
		<li>First we want to set up our registration key to a variable. This isn't required, but will make changing it and sharing code easier in the future.
		<li>Next, we make the request by sending a json object holding the URL, method, body, and our key.
		<li>Lastly, we can handle the response much like that of the GET request making sure to include some error handling. 
	</ul>
	<p>Of course, this can have more Series IDs if you would like to query for additional information.

	<p>Here we are using see a sample response when searching for the same information from our GET request about Web Developers in Software Publishing (bottom result) and a new Series ID query about the number of Web Developers in Other Information Services (top result). 
	
	<p>The value results show us that while there are quite a few web developers working in the software industry, there are twice that number working in other information services.
