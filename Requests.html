	<h3>Requests</h3>
	
	<p>The official documentation has several examples of requests in popular languages, which you can see pointed to but our old friend, red arrow:

	<div><img src='AvailableCodes.png'></div>

	<P>As you will quickly notice, it is lacking any examples of JavaScript, our language of choice for this guide. 
	
	<P>On Version 2, we can make a single series request with a GET and a multiple series request with a POST. We can also specify what years we are interested in and a few other data results with POSTs. 
	
	<p>The single series request will take one Series ID while the multiple series requests takes more than one Series ID in addition to being able to accept optional year parameters and also a few other handy specifiers to get that extra data we mentioned.

	<P>The next few pages will take you through these common queries.
